 * Stream functions are used for unbuffered stream operations. All of the

 * state information.
 *
 * <p>These functions may be used for any input/output operations with streams.
 * Each stream should be initialized first by call to the \c rtxStreamInit
 * function. After initialization, the stream may be opened for reading or
 * writing by calling one of the following functions:
 *   - \c rtxStreamFileOpen
 *   - \c rtxStreamFileAttach
 *   - \c rtxStreamSocketAttach
 *   - \c rtxStreamMemoryCreate
 *   - \c rtxStreamMemoryAttach
