/**
 * @defgroup ccfSList Linked List Utility Functions
 *
 * Singly linked list structures have only a single link pointer and can
 * therefore only be traversed in a single direction (forward). The node
 * structures consume less memory than those of a doubly linked list.
 *
 * Another difference between the singly linked list implementation and doubly
 * linked lists is that the singly linked list uses conventional memory
 * allocation functions (C malloc and free) for less storage instead of the
 * rtxMem functions. Therefore, it is not a requirement to have an initialized
 * context structure to work with these lists. However, performance may suffer
 * if the lists become large due to the use of non-optimized memory management.
