 * <H1>C Common Runtime Library Functions</H1>
 *
 * The <B>C run-time common library</B> contains common C functions used by
 * the low-level encode/decode functions. These functions are identified
 * by their <I>rtx</I> prefixes.
 *
 * The categories of functions provided are as follows:<UL>
 * <LI>Context management functions handle the allocation,
 * initialization, and destruction of context variables
 * (variables of type OSCTXT) that handle the working data used
 * during the encoding or decoding of a message.</LI>
 * <LI>Memory allocation macros and functions provide an optimized memory
 * management interface.</LI>
 * <LI>Doubly linked list (DList) functions are used to manipulate linked
 * list structures that are used to model repeating XSD types and
 * elements.</LI>
 * <LI>UTF-8 and Unicode character string functions provide support
 * for conversions to and from these formats in C or C++.</LI>
 * <LI>Date/time conversion functions provide utilities for converting
 * system and structured numeric date/time values to XML schema standard
 * string format.</LI>
 * <LI>Pattern matching function compare strings against patterns specified
 * using regular expressions (regexp's).</LI>
 * <LI>Diagnostic trace functions allow the output of trace messages
 * to standard output.</LI>
 * <LI>Error formatting and print functions allow information about
 * encode/decode errors to be added to a context block structure
 * and printed out.</LI>
 * <LI>Memory buffer management functions handle the allocation,
 * expansion, and de-allocation of dynamic memory buffers used by some
 * encode/decode functions.</LI>
 * <LI>Formatted print functions allow binary data to be
 * formatted and printed to standard output and other output devices.</LI>
 * <LI>Big Integer helper functions are arbitrary-precision integer
 * manipulating functions used to maintain big integers.</LI>
 * </UL>
