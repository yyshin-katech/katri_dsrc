 * @defgroup buffermanfun Memory Buffer Management Functions
 * @{
 *
 * Memory buffer management functions handle the allocation, expansion, and
 * deallocation of dynamic memory buffers used by some encode/decode functions.
 * Dynamic memory buffers are buffers that can grow or shrink to hold variable
 * sized amounts of data. This group of functions allows data to be appended to
 * buffers, to be set within buffers, and to be retrieved from buffers.
 * Currently, these functions are used within the generated SAX decode routines
 * to collect data as it is parsed by an XML parser.
