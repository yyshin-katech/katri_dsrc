 * The streaming BER functions handle the BER encode of primitive ASN.1 data
 * types. Calls to these functions are assembled in the C source code generated
 * by the ASN1C compiler (with -stream option) to accomplish the encoding of
 * complex ASN.1 structures. These functions are also directly callable from
 * within a user's application program if the need to accomplish a low level
 * encoding function exists. In contrast to the non-streaming C BER functions,
 * these operate with streams, rather than the memory buffer, the sources or
 * destination.  Thus, the data may be encoded directly to the file stream
 * or socket output stream and may be decoded directly from the file or
 * socket input stream. @{
