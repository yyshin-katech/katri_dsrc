 * This routine reads the BER message into the

 * dynamic buffer will be allocated and returned as ppDestBuffer. Length of
 * the message will be returned in pMessageSize.
 *
 * @param pctxt        Pointer to a context structure. This provides a storage
 *                       area for the function to store all working variables
 *                       that must be maintained between function calls.
 * @param socket       The socket to read from. It should be already connected
 *                       TCP socket.
 * @param buffer       The static buffer to receive the parsed data. Can be NULL.
 * @param bufsiz       The size of the buffer to receive the parsed data.
 *                        Should be 0, if \c buffer is NULL.
 * @param ppDestBuffer The pointer to receive the destination buffer pointer. If
 *                        \c buffer is static, this parameter can be NULL.
 * @param pMessageSize The pointer to integer to receive the size of read
 *                        message.
 * @return             Completion status of operation:
 *                       - 0 (0) = success,
 *                       - negative return value is error.
